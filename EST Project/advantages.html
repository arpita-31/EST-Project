            <h3>Key Advantages of 5G</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>1. Faster Data Speeds</h4>
                    <p>5G networks are significantly faster than 4G, allowing users to download large files, stream 4K videos, and browse seamlessly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>2. Lower Latency</h4>
                    <p>With reduced delay times, 5G improves real-time communications, making applications like online gaming, video conferencing, and autonomous driving more responsive.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>3. Increased Connectivity</h4>
                    <p>5G enables more devices to connect simultaneously without affecting performance. This is crucial for smart cities, IoT (Internet of Things), and smart homes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>4. Improved Network Reliability</h4>
                    <p>With robust infrastructure, 5G ensures reliable network connections, making dropped calls and slow internet speeds less frequent.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>5. Enhanced Industrial Applications</h4>
                    <p>Industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics will benefit from 5G, enabling more precise operations, real-time monitoring, and smart automation.</p>

            <h3>Key Strategies to Reduce Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>1. Energy-Efficient Infrastructure</h4>
                    <p>One of the primary concerns is energy consumption. By designing more energy-efficient cell towers and utilizing renewable energy sources, the carbon footprint of 5G infrastructure can be minimized.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>2. Recycling and E-Waste Management</h4>
                    <p>Promoting responsible recycling of 5G-compatible devices and reducing electronic waste by encouraging users to recycle old phones and gadgets is crucial in managing the environmental impact of new technologies.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>3. Smart Data Management</h4>
                    <p>Reducing unnecessary data transmission can help lower energy consumption in data centers. Utilizing edge computing and optimizing network traffic can make 5G operations more sustainable.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>4. Reducing Exposure to Electromagnetic Radiation</h4>
                    <p>Though 5G radiation is considered safe by international guidelines, reducing exposure by optimizing tower placement and encouraging responsible usage of devices can alleviate public concerns.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>5. Promoting Sustainable Tech Development</h4>
                    <p>Encouraging tech companies to prioritize sustainability in the production and deployment of 5G technology, including responsible sourcing of materials and the development of eco-friendly products.</p>

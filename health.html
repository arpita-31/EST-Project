            <h2>Understanding Health Concerns</h2>
            <p>As 5G technology rolls out worldwide, concerns have been raised about its potential effects on human health. These concerns primarily revolve around the increased exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) and the long-term impacts of this exposure. Letâ€™s take a look at the major health-related issues associated with 5G.</p>

            <h3>Key Health Concerns</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>1. Exposure to Electromagnetic Radiation</h4>
                    <p>5G operates at higher frequencies than previous generations, increasing public exposure to electromagnetic radiation. While the World Health Organization states that EMF levels are safe, ongoing research continues to explore the long-term effects.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>2. Potential Impact on Human Cells</h4>
                    <p>Some studies suggest that exposure to higher frequency radiation may impact biological processes, potentially affecting cell growth and function, though evidence is still inconclusive.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>3. Increased Exposure in Urban Areas</h4>
                    <p>With the dense deployment of 5G towers and small cells, especially in urban areas, concerns arise about constant exposure to radiation in densely populated regions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>4. Sensitivity to Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs)</h4>
                    <p>There have been reports of individuals claiming to be sensitive to electromagnetic fields, experiencing symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and dizziness, although there is no conclusive scientific evidence linking these symptoms to EMF exposure.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>5. Long-term Research Gaps</h4>
                    <p>Many experts emphasize that while no direct harm has been conclusively linked to 5G, the technology is new, and long-term studies are needed to fully understand its health impacts.</p>

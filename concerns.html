            <h3>Key Environmental Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>1. Increased Energy Consumption</h4>
                    <p>5G networks require more infrastructure, including more cell towers and data centers, which leads to higher energy use and greater carbon emissions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>2. Impact on Wildlife</h4>
                    <p>The expansion of 5G infrastructure can disrupt natural habitats, posing risks to birds, insects, and other wildlife due to electromagnetic radiation and physical installations.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>3. E-Waste and Device Manufacturing</h4>
                    <p>The need for 5G-compatible devices accelerates the production of smartphones, routers, and IoT gadgets, contributing to electronic waste and the environmental toll of mining rare earth materials.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>4. Radiation Concerns</h4>
                    <p>Although research is ongoing, there are growing concerns about the long-term health and environmental effects of increased radiation from 5G technology.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>5. Sustainability in Tech Development</h4>
                    <p>Efforts are being made to reduce 5G's environmental impact through energy-efficient network designs, green energy solutions, and recycling programs for old devices.</p>
